# xmppqr

`xmppqr` is an XMPP server that uses `wolfSSL`/`wolfCrypt` for TLS and cryptographic primitives, with an experimental post-quantum end-to-end encryption stack under active development.

This README is intentionally operational. It covers installation, configuration, running the server, account management, and client troubleshooting. Protocol design details live in [docs/x3dhpq-xep-draft.md](./docs/x3dhpq-xep-draft.md) and federation notes live in [docs/federation.md](./docs/federation.md).

## License

**AGPLv3.** See [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

## Status

`xmppqr` is still **pre-alpha**, but the repository is no longer just a design stub. The current tree contains:

- `xmppqrd`: the server daemon
- `xmppqrctl`: the admin CLI for migrations, user management, and TLS probing
- PostgreSQL-backed persistent storage
- client-to-server listeners for STARTTLS and direct TLS
- WebSocket XMPP transport
- message archive management, PEP, roster/presence, message carbons, push hooks, MUC, stream management, and in-band registration
- server-to-server federation with STARTTLS and dialback
- the in-repo `x3dhpq` implementation and test client

Important caveats for operators right now:

- There are no release artifacts or distro packages yet. Installation is from source.
- The daemon still has developer bootstrap behavior: it creates or updates one local user on startup via `-dev-user` and `-dev-pass`.
- The daemon requires an explicit TLS certificate and key. It does not generate development certificates.
- The default database driver is in-memory. That is convenient for development, but it is not persistent and `xmppqrctl` intentionally refuses to manage users against it.
- The project is moving quickly. Expect config and runtime behavior to continue changing.

## What To Read

- Use this README for deployment and operations.
- Use [docs/federation.md](./docs/federation.md) for S2S setup and dialback behavior.
- Use [docs/x3dhpq-xep-draft.md](./docs/x3dhpq-xep-draft.md) for the protocol and trust model.

## Prerequisites

Source builds currently require:

- Go `1.26+`
- `pkg-config`
- PostgreSQL `15+` for persistent storage
- wolfSSL development headers and library visible through `pkg-config wolfssl`

The wolfCrypt wrappers in this tree are targeted at wolfSSL `5.9.1`. The code uses cgo, so `pkg-config --cflags --libs wolfssl` must work on the build host.

Features currently used in-tree include:

- TLS 1.2/1.3
- X25519
- Ed25519
- HKDF
- AES-GCM
- HMAC / SHA-2
- ML-KEM-768

ML-DSA support is also wired into the tree, but whether it works on your machine depends on how your local wolfSSL was built.

## Build

Build the daemon and admin CLI:

```bash
go build -o ./bin/xmppqrd ./cmd/xmppqrd
go build -o ./bin/xmppqrctl ./cmd/xmppqrctl
```

If you only want to check the admin CLI path:

```bash
go test ./cmd/xmppqrctl/...
```

## Installation Layout

A minimal source install usually looks like this:

```text
/etc/xmppqr/xmppqrd.yaml
/etc/xmppqr/tls/cert.pem
/etc/xmppqr/tls/key.pem
/usr/local/bin/xmppqrd
/usr/local/bin/xmppqrctl
```

## TLS Files

`xmppqrd` requires these files to exist before startup:

```text
/etc/xmppqr/tls/cert.pem
/etc/xmppqr/tls/key.pem
```

How those files are produced is outside the scope of `xmppqr` itself. The daemon just reads PEM files from the configured paths.

For local testing, a self-signed certificate is fine. One simple manual flow is:

```bash
install -d /etc/xmppqr/tls
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
  -days 30 \
  -subj "/CN=example.com" \
  -keyout /etc/xmppqr/tls/key.pem \
  -out /etc/xmppqr/tls/cert.pem
chmod 600 /etc/xmppqr/tls/key.pem
```

For real deployments, use your normal certificate management flow instead, for example Let's Encrypt or another ACME client. In that case, point `tls.cert_file` and `tls.key_file` at the live certificate and private key paths you already manage on the host, or copy/symlink them into `/etc/xmppqr/tls/`.

Practical guidance:

- Use a self-signed certificate only for local development or controlled client testing.
- Use a publicly trusted certificate for normal client and federation traffic.
- Make sure the certificate CN/SAN matches the hostname clients and remote servers actually connect to.
- Keep the private key readable only by the account running `xmppqrd`.

One practical flow is:

```bash
install -d /etc/xmppqr /etc/xmppqr/tls
cp internal/config/example.yaml /etc/xmppqr/xmppqrd.yaml
install -m 0755 ./bin/xmppqrd /usr/local/bin/xmppqrd
install -m 0755 ./bin/xmppqrctl /usr/local/bin/xmppqrctl
```

## Configuration

Start from the sample file at [internal/config/example.yaml](/home/dan/src/xmppqr/internal/config/example.yaml).

The main sections are:

- `server`: XMPP domain and host identity
- `listeners`: C2S, S2S, upload, metrics, and optional WebSocket enablement
- `tls`: certificate paths and PQ-hybrid preference
- `db`: storage backend
- `log`: level, format, stanza redaction
- `modules`: feature toggles and limits
- `s2s`: federation settings

Minimal persistent configuration:

```yaml
server:
  domain: example.com
  hostname: xmpp.example.com
  resource_prefix: xmppqr

listeners:
  c2s_starttls: ":5222"
  c2s_directtls: ":5223"
  s2s: ":5269"
  http_upload: ":5443"
  admin_pprof: "127.0.0.1:6060"
  websocket: ""

tls:
  cert_file: /etc/xmppqr/tls/cert.pem
  key_file: /etc/xmppqr/tls/key.pem
  min_version: TLS1.2
  prefer_pq_hybrid: true

db:
  driver: postgres
  dsn: "host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 user=xmppqr password=secret dbname=xmppqr sslmode=disable"
  max_conns: 20
  migrate_on_start: true

log:
  level: info
  format: text
  redact_stanzas: true

modules:
  mam: true
  push: true
  carbons: true
  muc: true
  http_upload: true
  pep: true
  sm: true
  csi: true
  ibr: false
  x3dhpq_item_max_bytes: 262144

s2s:
  enabled: false
  dialback_enabled: true
  insecure_skip_verify: false
  allowed_domains: []
```

Notes that matter in practice:

- `server.domain` is required and must match the XMPP domain clients use in their JIDs.
- At least one of `listeners.c2s_starttls`, `listeners.c2s_directtls`, or `listeners.s2s` must be set.
- `tls.cert_file` and `tls.key_file` are required by `xmppqrd` and must point to readable PEM files.
- `db.driver: memory` is useful only for throwaway local testing.
- `admin_pprof` serves both Prometheus metrics at `/metrics` and Go pprof handlers. Keep it loopback-only unless you really mean to expose it.
- The HTTP upload and WebSocket server is plain HTTP inside the daemon. If you expose it on the internet, put it behind TLS termination or a reverse proxy.

## Database Setup

Create a PostgreSQL database and role:

```sql
CREATE ROLE xmppqr LOGIN PASSWORD 'secret';
CREATE DATABASE xmppqr OWNER xmppqr;
```

Then either let the daemon migrate automatically with `db.migrate_on_start: true`, or run migrations manually:

```bash
xmppqrctl migrate -config /etc/xmppqr/xmppqrd.yaml
```

## Running The Server

Development run with defaults:

```bash
./bin/xmppqrd
```

What that does by default:

- uses `localhost` as the domain if none is configured
- listens on `:5222` and `:5223`
- uses in-memory storage
- creates or updates a bootstrap user `test@localhost` with password `test`

Configured run:

```bash
xmppqrd -config /etc/xmppqr/xmppqrd.yaml -dev-user bootstrap -dev-pass 'change-me-now'
```

Current bootstrap behavior is important: the daemon always seeds a user on startup. Until that changes, set `-dev-user` and `-dev-pass` deliberately and rotate or remove that account after initial setup.

Useful listeners:

- `5222`: client-to-server STARTTLS
- `5223`: client-to-server direct TLS
- `5269`: server-to-server federation
- `5443`: HTTP upload service and, if enabled, `/xmpp-websocket`
- `127.0.0.1:6060`: metrics and pprof by default

## User Management

Persistent user management currently goes through `xmppqrctl` and PostgreSQL.

Create a user:

```bash
xmppqrctl useradd alice -config /etc/xmppqr/xmppqrd.yaml
```

Or pass the password non-interactively:

```bash
xmppqrctl useradd alice -config /etc/xmppqr/xmppqrd.yaml -password 'correct horse battery staple'
```

Replace an existing user:

```bash
xmppqrctl useradd alice -config /etc/xmppqr/xmppqrd.yaml -password 'new-password' -replace
```

List users:

```bash
xmppqrctl userlist -config /etc/xmppqr/xmppqrd.yaml
```

Delete a user:

```bash
xmppqrctl userdel alice -config /etc/xmppqr/xmppqrd.yaml
```

Operational details:

- The CLI stores local usernames, not full JIDs. `alice` becomes `alice@<server.domain>` for login purposes.
- `xmppqrctl` requires `db.driver: postgres`. It will fail on the in-memory backend by design.
- Passwords are stored as SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-512 material plus an Argon2-style storage hash payload used by the server code.

## Client Configuration

For a normal XMPP client, configure:

- JID: `alice@example.com`
- Username: `alice`
- Domain: `example.com`
- Password: the password set with `xmppqrctl`
- Host: the server that presents the certificate for `example.com`
- Port: `5222` for STARTTLS or `5223` for direct TLS

Authentication currently includes:

- `SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS`
- `SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS`
- `SCRAM-SHA-512`
- `SCRAM-SHA-256`
- `PLAIN` for legacy clients

If you enable in-band registration with `modules.ibr: true`, clients can also try account creation through XMPP itself. For stable deployments, admin-created accounts are the safer path today.

## WebSocket Transport

If `listeners.websocket` is non-empty, `xmppqrd` enables XMPP-over-WebSocket at:

```text
/xmpp-websocket
```

Current behavior to know:

- the WebSocket request must include `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: xmpp`
- the handler is served by the same HTTP server as file upload
- SCRAM-PLUS channel binding is not available over WebSocket because the TLS exporter is not exposed through `net/http`

In practice, terminate HTTPS in a reverse proxy and forward WebSocket traffic to the daemon.

## Federation

Federation support is present and documented separately in [docs/federation.md](./docs/federation.md).

At a high level today:

- outbound and inbound S2S use STARTTLS
- dialback is the main authentication mechanism
- optional mTLS wiring exists in config
- remote-domain allowlisting is supported

For deployment, you still need the standard XMPP DNS and certificate hygiene:

- `A`/`AAAA` records for the host
- `_xmpp-server._tcp` SRV if you do not use the default host/port
- certificates whose names match what peers connect to

## Troubleshooting

### The client cannot log in

Check the basics first:

- the client JID domain matches `server.domain`
- the user exists in PostgreSQL, not only in a previous in-memory run
- the password was set against the same config file the daemon is using
- the client is using the correct port and TLS mode

Useful commands:

```bash
xmppqrctl userlist -config /etc/xmppqr/xmppqrd.yaml
xmppqrctl tls-probe xmpp.example.com:5223
```

### `xmppqrctl useradd` says the storage backend is invalid

That usually means the config still points at:

```yaml
db:
  driver: memory
```

Switch to PostgreSQL and run migrations.

### Users disappear after restart

You are running the memory backend. That is expected. Configure:

```yaml
db:
  driver: postgres
```

### TLS fails or clients reject the certificate

Common causes:

- the configured cert or key path is wrong or unreadable
- the certificate CN/SAN does not match the hostname clients connect to
- the client is pointed at the wrong host for the JID domain

Use:

```bash
xmppqrctl tls-probe xmpp.example.com:5223
```

That prints the negotiated protocol version, cipher, named group, whether PQ-hybrid key exchange was used, and peer certificate count.

### STARTTLS works but direct TLS does not, or vice versa

Verify which listener the client is using:

- `5222` expects plain TCP followed by STARTTLS
- `5223` expects TLS immediately

Using the wrong mode on the right port will fail before authentication.

### WebSocket clients fail immediately

Check all of the following:

- the WebSocket client is connecting to `/xmpp-websocket`
- it sends `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: xmpp`
- you terminated HTTPS in front of the daemon if the client expects `wss://`

### Registration works nowhere

In-band registration is only advertised when `modules.ibr: true`.

### HTTP upload links are wrong or unusable

The current upload service builds URLs from `listeners.http_upload` and serves plain HTTP from the daemon. If you deploy behind a reverse proxy or external TLS terminator, make sure your public URL layout matches what clients receive, or front it with a consistent public endpoint.

### Federation does not come up

Check:

- `s2s.enabled: true`
- TCP `5269` reachability
- DNS SRV or fallback host resolution
- a certificate peers accept

Then read [docs/federation.md](./docs/federation.md) for the current dialback and STARTTLS behavior.

## Observability

By default the admin listener exposes:

- Prometheus metrics at `http://127.0.0.1:6060/metrics`
- Go pprof at `http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/`

Keep `log.redact_stanzas: true` unless you are actively debugging protocol flow and accept the privacy trade-off.

## Current Gaps

This repo is advancing quickly, but it is not a finished production server yet. The main operational gaps today are:

- no packaged releases
- no polished service manager units or installer
- bootstrap-user behavior still baked into the daemon
- HTTP upload and WebSocket deployment still expect operator-side proxying/TLS decisions
- ongoing churn in the x3dhpq feature set

If you want to evaluate it now, the most realistic path is: build from source, use PostgreSQL, run explicit TLS certs, create accounts with `xmppqrctl`, and keep the deployment small and supervised.
